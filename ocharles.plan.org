#+TITLE: Zero to Quake 3

Trying to build as much of Quake 3 as I can using Haskell & Vulkan.

* Todo
** [ ] Fix on-termination errors :correctness:

** [ ] Add texturing :progress:

** [ ] Determine the presentation queue :correctness:

** [ ] Check for VK_KHR_SWAPCHAIN_EXTENSION_NAME :correctness:

** [ ] Triple buffering :correctness:

** [ ] Frame fences to limit in flight frames :correctness:

** [ ] Check that VK_KHR_swapchain is supported :correctness:

** [ ] Use cabal2nix to generate Nix environment :refactoring:

** [ ] Move logging from main to functions themselves :refactoring:

** [ ] Fixed physics timestep :correctness:
* <2018-09-14 Fri>
** [X] Better input handling :correctness:
* <2018-09-13 Thu>

** [X] Remove accidental rotation of the world :bugs:
** [X] Use the Vulkan correction matrix :correctness:

** [X] Weird z-fighting :bugs:

** [X] Correctly determine the format of the depth buffer :correctness:
** [X] Remove Quake3.Vertex coupling from Vulkan.* modules

* <2018-09-11 Tue>
** [X] BSP Loading :progress:
* <2018-09-08 Sat>

** [X] Add a first person camera :progress:


* Thursday
** [X] Use an index buffer :progress:

** [X] Make use of the depth buffer :progress:


* Wednesday
** [X] Introduce model/view/projection matrix via a uniform buffer :progress:


* Sunday
** [X] Find out how to correctly use vulkan-loader :correctness:

It currently requires me to change =LD_LIBRARY_PATH= to contain
vulkan-loader.so.

** [X] Use vertex buffers


* Friday
** [X] A DSL for building Vulkan structs :refactoring:

** [X] Resource cleanup :correctness:

** [X] Render a triangle! :progress:


* Thursday
** [X] Finish recording a render pass to the command buffer

** [X] Add the validation layer :correctness:

** [X] Submit the command buffer for rendering

** [X] We have a blue screen!


* Tuesday
